## Description:  
Handle API errors and provide feedback to the user. Also, add a "Bot is typing..." indicator while waiting for the API response.

## Requirements:
- Implement error handling for cases when the API request fails. Display a message like "Sorry, something went wrong" in the chat window if the API call fails.
- While the bot is waiting for the API response, show a "typing..." indicator in the chat window.
- Remove the "typing..." indicator once the bot's response is received or an error occurs.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- The "typing..." indicator appears while waiting for the API response.
- If the API request fails, an error message is displayed in the chat window.
- The "typing..." indicator disappears when the response or error message is displayed.
