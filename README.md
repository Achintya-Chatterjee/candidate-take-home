# Story/Task

Lost Girls Vintage, a retail store that sells vintage clothing, has asked Midwest AI Solution to develop a chatbot interface that can help users interact with their support team through a conversational interface.

The following tickets are in the tickets/ folder, and each ticket is required to be completed:



- Ticket 1.1: Create the basic layout for the chatbot, including a chat window, input field, and send button.
- Ticket 1.2: Implement functionality to display user messages in the chat window after the user sends a message.
- Ticket 2.1: Fetch a response from the dummy API when the user sends a message and display the botâ€™s response.
- Ticket 2.2: Handle API errors, add a "Bot is typing..." indicator, and ensure graceful handling of failure cases.


You have been placed on the team as a frontend engineer and assigned the tickets found under `tickets/`. **Each ticket is required to completed.**
